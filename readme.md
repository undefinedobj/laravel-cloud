Laravel Cloud was an attempt to build a "Forge Pro" for applications that needed more robust load balancing and scaling features.

This was eventually replaced by Laravel Vapor; however, I am open sourcing the code for review purposes since it is the only significant Laravel application I have written that I am able to open source.

Again, this code is only for review. This code may not be used or deployed for any purpose without my consent.

Laravel 作者公开 “Forge Pro” 源码

Laravel 作者 Taylor 在 Twitter 上公开了一个个人项目 ——Forge Pro。声称这是 Vapor 的前身。其中后端的功能已经全部写好。
